# What is this project?

This started out with me noticing that I had a few extra devices laying around, and a curiousity to see if I could put them to work. This was first realized with my project here: [miners](https://github.com/NanoBytesInc/miners), but that was cumbersome and a little scary for the uninitiated. So now we are here, with an app that wraps up all of the functionality ofd the last project with some extra features that actually put it notably ahead of the other mobile miners on the market. 

# Features

* It has an OLED friendly mode
* Allows you to enter you wallet from a QR code
* The fastest mining on the market (by roughly %20 on high end phones)
* Allows you to mine to your own pools
* Can mine any CryptoNight coin, but has built in support for Monero, Electroneum, Aeon, Sumokoin, and Bytecoin (and soon to be MoneroV).
* Saves your configurations so they do not need to constantly be re-entered
* Highly stable (my 5 Android devices have been running for over a week, 24/7 without a problem)
* Works with the screen off
* Clean interface
* Shows an estimated progress in the current share
* You can un-tick the donation option
* Shows your current balance for the supported pools you can mine to

# What it runs on

As of right now I have tested this app on Android Lollipop, Nougat, and Oreo; with ARM 64, ARM 86, and Intel Atom i686 CPU architechures.

It runs on TVs, Tablets, and of course phones...
Everything except iOS :D

# Is it open soruce?

It will be! Soon! I am 100% for open source code, and this is no exception. However, my intention for this app would be to add it to the PLay Store, and I would be disapointed if this opertunity is "sniped" by an opertunistic stranger. Thus, I will release the source code for this app as soon as I have secured a spot in the Play Store.

As far as I know the XMRig GPL does not apply to this app. I have personally contacted the developers of the XMRig software, and they aggred that since I am not using the XMRig source code in the app itself, and I have published the source code for the binaries that come with the app, that I am fine with keeping the source code for the app close to my chest.

Though, as I said, I will be releasing it :D Then you all can change / modify it however you want and come compete with me :)

# If you want you pool added into the app

Feel 100% free to contact me! I want this to work for everyone, and as a student, I have a lot of time to tinker with things :D
